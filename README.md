## Description:

A react app for management of my shared apartment.

For now we have a initial screen with the weather for my City, Curitiba and the page to manage water gallons, that we buy almost every week and want to keep track of who`s time is it to pay.

The Front-end is made with react, Redux, bootstrap and shard-react.

The back-end is in the folder `server` and it`s done with Node.JS, express and MongoDB;
