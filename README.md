A react native app for management of my shared apartment.

For now we have a initial screen with the weather for my City, Curitiba and the page to manage water gallons, that we buy almost every week and want to keep track of who`s time is it to pay.

The backend is in Node.js and Atlas MongoDB, and the project for it can be found here;

The app is made with React-native, redux and styled-components.
